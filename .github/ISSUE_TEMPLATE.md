Please DO NOT include more than one feature request or bug in a single issue.  Use a different issue for every topic.  

If you are reporting a bug or un-styled Firefox feature, please include all relevant info, including:

* browser version (stable, beta, developer, nightly)
* operating system (mac, windows, linux etc.)
* explicit instructions how to get to the broken feature/webpage
* screenshots
* how you are using ShadowFox (complete userChrome/Content, userChrome/userContent_imports, gulp)

If you are reporting a bug or un-styled webextension feature, please include all relevant info, including:

* webextension name
* browser version (stable, beta, developer, nightly)
* operating system (mac, windows, linux etc.)
* explicit instructions how to get to the broken/unstyled feature or webpage
* screenshots

If you are submitting a feature request for a webextension, please include all relevant info, including:

* webextension name
* link to the webextension in the AMO store
* what needs to be styled (settings in about:addons, popup etc.)

If you are submitting a different feature request, please describe it in as much detail as possible, including why you/others would benefit from it.

The above are simply guidelines, not hard and fast rules.  Please use common sense and provide the relevant info needed to solve a problem or implement a feature request in a quick manner.
