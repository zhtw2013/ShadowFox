[Work in progress - page NOT complete yet with all those who have contributed]

I would like to thank all those who have contributed to this project in any manner, whether it be contributing code, making suggestions, pointing out bugs, or helping guide the direction of ShadowFox. Specifically, I would like to thank the following people:

- @CarlColijn: Wrote the updater script for Windows users (`ShadowFox_updater_wondows.vbs`).

- u/loopy750: Large number of Windows specific fixes in addition to a multitude of theme enhancements and improvements.

- u/markdarkness: This project wouldn't have developed into what it is now without all your feedback and suggestions in the projects early stages.  Also contributed some Windows specific fixes and came up with the name "ShadowFox."

- @CaptaPraelium: Continual feedback, suggestions and help guiding the project to become what it is now.
