# What is ShadowFox?

ShadowFox is a collection of `userChrome.css` and `userContent.css` tweaks to supplement and expand the dark theme provided by Mozilla.

# What modifications does ShadowFox make?

All modifications can be split into two categories: (1) Changes to the user interface (`userChrome.css`) and (2) Changes to webpages (`userContent.css`).

## userContent tweaks

#### about: pages

All `about:` pages have been styled (e.g. `about:addons`, `about:preferences`, `about:config`, `about:profiles` etc.)

#### Webpages

The following webpages have been styled to match the dark theme:

* addons.mozilla.org
* `view-source` pages
* manifest.json pages
* Dierectory listing pages (`file:///`)
* `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/...`
* pdfs

#### Webextension Tweaks

Themes for 20+ popular webextensions have been made.  By nature, these changes can not go into effect without user action.  To see what extensions have been styled, as well as how to make the changes go into effect, see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShadowFoxCSS/comments/7yt5c0/test_post/).
