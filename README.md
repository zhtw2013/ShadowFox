ShadowFox was inspired by changes made in Firefox 57, which limited the amount addons could customize both the user interface and "protected" web pages.

This project aims at creating a universal dark theme for Firefox while adhering to the modern design principles set by Mozilla.

## Preview

ShadowFox styles the entire user interface, protected webpages (such as `about:` pages and addons.mozilla.org), and over 20 popular addons.
